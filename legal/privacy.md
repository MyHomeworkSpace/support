Third party applications may request access to your account. In the event that they do, you will be brought to a MyHomeworkSpace page explaining what information the application is requesting to access. You will then have the option to either grant access, or deny access. If you grant access, then later change your mind, you may revoke access by signing into MyHomeworkSpace, and selecting "Settings," then "Applications," then "Revoke Access." MyHomeworkSpace cannot control what these applications do with your data, and therefore cannot be held responsible for data granted to external applications.
