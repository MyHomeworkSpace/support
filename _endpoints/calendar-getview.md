### Event tags
Some events may contain more data than just the name, start, and end. This is referred to as an event's _metadata_ and is stored in the `tags` object of an event. The `tags` objects is a key-value store, where the keys are numeric and correspond to different information that may be stored with an event. For example, a Homework event may have a `tags` object that looks like this, where `2` is the number that corresponds to the "homework" tag:

```json
"tags": {
	"2": {
		"id": 24,
		"name": "Read next chapter",
		"due": "2019-05-23",
		"desc": "",
		"complete": 0,
		"classId": 3,
		"userId": 1
	}
}
```

While a given tag may not be present on all events, if it is present, it is guaranteed to be the correct type. For example, the "building name" tag will, if present, always be a string. See the sample response below for more examples. A full list of tags is below:

| name | numeric value | description |

| Description | 1 | string: A description associated with the event. |
